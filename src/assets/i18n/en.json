    "TEXT": "I’m a backend-focused software engineer driven by building reliable, scalable systems for complex business domains. My core stack is Java, Spring Boot, AWS, and PostgreSQL, but I enjoy working across the whole product — from cloud infrastructure to frontend and mobile.\n\nOver the last 6 years, I’ve launched SaaS platforms, high-load fintech solutions, and IoT integrations — both as a team player and as a freelance consultant. My approach is pragmatic and product-oriented: I care about clean code, automation, and creating solutions that make a difference for users and business.\n\nI love working in cross-functional teams, mentoring juniors, and learning new tech. If you have a challenging project or an idea to discuss, let’s connect!",
