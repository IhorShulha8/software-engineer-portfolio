    "TEXT": "I am a backend-focused software engineer driven by building reliable, scalable systems for complex business domains. My core stack is Java, Spring Boot, AWS, and PostgreSQL, but I enjoy working across the whole product – from cloud infrastructure to frontend and mobile.\n\nOver the past 6 years, I have launched SaaS platforms, high-load fintech solutions, and microservices — both as part of a team and as a freelance consultant. My approach is pragmatic and product-oriented: I care about clean code, automation, and creating solutions that make a difference for users and business.\n\nI enjoy working in cross-functional teams, mentoring junior colleagues, and learning new technologies.
